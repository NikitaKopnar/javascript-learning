WHAT IS ANGULARJS??
AngularJS is a very powerful JavaScript Framework. It is used in Single Page Application (SPA) projects.
It extends HTML DOM with additional attributes and makes it more responsive to user actions.

ADVANTAGES OF ANGULARJS :
1. AngularJS code is unit testable.
2. AngularJS provides reusable components.
4. It provides the capability to create Single Page Application in a very clean and maintainable way.

DISADVANTAGES :
Not secure
Not Degradable
Not supported everywhere

MODEL :
The model is responsible for managing application data.
It responds to the request from view and to the instructions from controller to update itself.

SCOPE :
Scope refers to the application model. It acts like a glue between the application controller and the view

Directives :
ng-app − This directive defines and links an AngularJS application to HTML
ng-model − This directive binds the values of AngularJS application data to HTML input controls
ng-bind − This directive binds the AngularJS Application data to HTML tags.

WHAT IS JS??
JavaScript is a lightweight and object-oriented scripting language 
used to create dynamic HTML pages with interactive effects within a webpage.

ADVANTAGES :
Less server interaction
Immediate feedback to the visitors
Increased interactivity
Richer interfaces

DISADVANTAGES :
1) The browser interprets JavaScript differently in different browsers.
   Thus, the code must be run on various platforms before publishing.
2) Browser support : The browser interprets JavaScript differently in different browsers
3) JavaScript only supports single inheritance and not multiple inheritance.




DIFFERENCE



COMPONENT VS DIRECTIVE
1. Templates are the mandatory property and always required in Component, but Directive doesn’t always require them.
2. Only one component can be present per DOM element. There can be more than one directive in a DOM element.
3. Components should never modify any data or DOM that is out of their own scope. 
   Directives have isolated scopes, by default the child inherits the scope from its parent.


ANGULAR VS ANGULARJS
1. Angular is typescript based and angularjs is js based
2.  Angular is component-based while AngularJS uses directives.
3. Angular uses components that are directives with templates but Angularjs framework has a model-view-controller
4. AngularJS does not provide mobile support while Angular supports mobile.
5. angular uses CLI but angular js uses third party IDE

OBSERVABLES :
Observables provide support for passing messages between parts of your application.
The subscriber function defines how to obtain or generate values or messages to be published.
Reactive programming enables the data stream to be emitted from one source called Observable 
and the emitted data stream to be caught by other sources called Observer through a process called subscription.
